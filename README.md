# python-jamf
Programmatic Control of Jamf Pro

## Introduction

`python-jamf` is a Python 3 module to access the Jamf Pro Classic API. The Classic API is the primary tool for programmatic access to data on a Jamf Pro server to allow integrations with other utilities or systems. The concept behind it is to have a class or simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that maps directly to the API (https://example.com:8443/api).

The `python-jamf` API class doesn't hide anything from you. It handles the URL requests, authentication, and converts between XML/JSON to Python dictionaries/lists.

The python-jamf module also provides undocumented access to Jamf Admin functionality used for uploading items to Jamf Distribution Points.
